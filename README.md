Cargo: the Rust build tool and package manager
When you install Rustup you’ll also get the latest stable version of the Rust build tool and package manager, also known as Cargo. Cargo does lots of things:

build your project with cargo build
run your project with cargo run
test your project with cargo test
build documentation for your project with cargo doc
publish a library to crates.io with cargo publish
To test that you have Rust and Cargo installed, you can run this in your terminal of choice:

cargo --version
